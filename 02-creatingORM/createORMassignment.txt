1.) A RubyGem is package following set standards. Gems have the advantage of being easy to install and
    use with the Ruby package manager. A RubyGem includes a GemSpec with the Gem's requirements for the 
    system, other gems, and specific versions. If a gem is missing in the GemSpec Ruby will install all 
    required gems along with it and update any out of date ones so the Gem is usable. This allows gems 
    to use the functionality of many other gems without needing the user to have to track down and
    make sure each dependency meets the requirements.

2.) Eager loading is to write your code so there are a few queries which are executed once and attributed 
    to an object. Then accessing specific values only requires referencing part of the object and not 
    performing the queries again. This means less queries, but you use up more memory. In lazy loading 
    you do a query everytime you look up data. Less memory because the info isn't all stored, but it must
    query constantly.

3.)CREATE TABLE creates a new sql table. INSERT INTO inserts new info into an existing table.

4.) Extend makes the method part of the class itself and not an instance method. Include adds the method 
    as an instance method.

5.) #save! needs to be an instance method because it needs to be saving the data for a particular table to
    a particular instance. This way you can specify which instance you want to be saved.

6.) UPDATE star_wars_characters
    SET star_rating = 0
    WHERE character_name = "Jar-Jar Binks";

7.) We'll make a selection method that queries all data in the table into an array. Then we can make a method in 
    address_book that will call the selection method and return an array of all the entries in the table.
